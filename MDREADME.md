  ## Description 
  ---
    This project helps save a programmers time by generating a detailed and nice looking README file for their project. It prompts the user to enter values/descriptions for important README sections and outputs a markdown file that nicely displays all the information. This current README file that you are reading right now was also produced with the help of this generator.
